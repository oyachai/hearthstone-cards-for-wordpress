## Changelog

#### Version a.1
* Added rarity-colored links
* Changed the way cards are inserted into a post.  Instead of automatially detecting card names, the plugin now looks for card names inside a pair of square brackets.  This change avoids problems seen when a name of a card includes the name of another card.
